    <p1><b>CS537:</b> This course will introduce you to an exciting range of materials from the broad field of operating systems, including basic operating system structure, process and thread synchronization and concurrency, file systems and storage servers, memory management techniques, process scheduling and resource management, virtualization, security, and even distributed systems.</p1>
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <p2><b>CS540:</b> This course is about principles of knowledge-based search techniques, automatic deduction, knowledge representation using predicate logic, machine learning, probabilistic reasoning. Applications in tasks such as problem solving, data mining, game playing, natural language understanding, computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics.</p2>
                                                      <br/>
                                                      <br/>

    <p3><b>CS577:</b> This course is focus on basic paradigms for the design and analysis of efficient algorithms: greed, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, reductions, and the use of randomness. Computational intractability including typical NP-complete problems and ways to deal with them.</p3>
                                                      <br/>

    <p4><b>LIS351:</b> This course introduces you to current technologies and policy issues associated with digital information, with an emphasis on information-organization technologies. The course prepares you to handle information-organization and information-access challenges in your field of interest. You will become familiar with current approaches for organizing and describing digital information such that both people and computers can leverage it. You will learn how the Internet shapes access to and use of digital information, and you will use information technology to solve problems and help people.</p4>
